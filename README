MemQD is a high-performance, distributed memory queue message system.

Just like memcached ,all the queue data are store at the shared memeory.And use libevent to handle the requests.

MemQD source code is based on Memcached, a high-performance, distributed cache system.

It also use the memcache protocol(get/set/delete) to parse the request, so any memcached client can have connectivity with it.

Here is a simple test with telnet command:

[root@php103 ~]# telnet 127.0.0.1 11212
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to php103 (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.
